This is just a To Do app in React for me to learn different concepts. I didn't bother with design or scalability because that's not the point of this.

# Getting Started

Go to src/components/card/card.js, lines 12 to 15. That's the test data.

Uncomment that block and save to load it onto localStorage.
Comment it again to use the app normally.
